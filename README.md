  - Any input field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Building forms


### What I learned

With this challenge, I have improved my form-building skills. I have also learned how to add live messages to a form.

my biggest struggle is the formatting. I have been unable to add the credit card numbers output in groups of 4. I have looked at some formulas or functions but none of them have worked well for me or I lack the knowledge to implement them. Any tips or suggestions would be much appreciated.
Another pain point has been keeping absolute elements in position with responsive styles but I was able to overcome these challenges.

I have also added a box shadow to both cards but there seems to be an extra layer at the bottom of the card, which I can't remove unless I remove the shadow.

I have added some extra codes for fun, like correct or different error messages.
